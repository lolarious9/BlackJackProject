# BlackJackProject
Created for a class in 2021. The main branch is my original project, but it is outdated now and uses Vue2 which is now depreciated. I took the liberty of updating the project to support Vue 3 and also so I could get some screenshots as I hadn't kept any from the class. The game uses Bootstrap-vue, Vue's Composition API, and Vuex for state management. It uses an open source [API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) for drawing cards and deck management, the source code of which can be found [here](https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards)
